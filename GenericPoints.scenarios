Story: Generic points
    As a backend user
	I want to be able to operate on generic point features
    So that external components can use it.

    Scenario: Should create any element without cascading
        Given non abstract feature to create request 
			And new transaction 
			And new cascade edit option.
        When create generic point feature.
